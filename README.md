# Medical Image Classification Using Deep Learning
This repository contains a MATLAB script for classifying medical images using various deep learning algorithms, including CNN, DNN, RNN, and ResNet-50. The script uses MATLAB's Deep Learning Toolbox and Image Processing Toolbox to preprocess the images, build and train the networks, and evaluate their performance.

# Features
* User Interface for Image Selection: Allows the user to select an image file using a graphical interface.
* Data Preprocessing: Handles image data loading, resizing, and augmentation.
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Implements a CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for image classification.
* Deep Neural Network (DNN): Implements a simple DNN with fully connected layers and ReLU activations for classification.
* Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): Utilizes a sequence input and LSTM layers for image classification.
* ResNet-50: Implements a simplified version of ResNet-50 architecture for more accurate image classification.
* Performance Evaluation: Evaluates and prints the accuracy of each network on the training and validation datasets.
* Visualization: Displays the input image and its predicted class using each model.
